This is a repository for Center for Global Development RAs.

It is meant as a way to share code with ourselves, as well as serve as a resource for the greater development community. 

Github is not meant to be a dataset sharing community, since the file storage size limits are a bit lacking. 
So, we will be posting *links* to useful datasets and, if needed, instructions on how to download them.

Note, we will NOT be publishing anything confidential here (e.g. DHS datasets themselves, Household Survey Microdata that requires approval).

The code is mostly written in STATA and R. 

This experiment could fail! And that's okay...
