This is a repository for Center for Global Development RAs.

It is meant as a way to share code with ourselves, as well as serve as a resource for the greater development community. 

Github is not meant to be a dataset sharing community, since the file storage size limits are a bit lacking. 
So, we will be posting *links* to useful datasets and, if needed, instructions on how to download them.

We will NOT publish anything confidential here (e.g. DHS datasets themselves, Household Survey Microdata that requires approval).
